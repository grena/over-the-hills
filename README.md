## Over The Hills

I made this mini game for the **Akeneo Game Jam #4**, for the theme "Evasion". 
We had 2 weeks to do this game on our free time, I'd says I spent something like 6 evenings, so a bit less than 48h.

You can either download the game for Windows, or play it via web (can be slow...).
